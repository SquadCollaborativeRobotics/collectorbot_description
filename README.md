collectorbot_description
========================

Contains Config Files and Description files for Gazebo Simulation of SCR CollectorBot.

Make sure to have this repo and the collectorbot_gazebo repo under your catkin workspace before trying to run the simultaion. Also, be sure to copy the hokuyo folder inside this repo to your ~/.gazebo/models path (I would recommend using a link for this in case we need to change it in the future). This repo contains all the physical models we need to run the simulation, and is the primary area for changing robot behavior, configuration, and design when attempting to change the gazebo behavior.
